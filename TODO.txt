CODE
- Fix runFunction being dogshit
- Fix requiring admin mode (AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
- CONFIG
  - Add XML & INDENT parsing to readConfig()
  - create writeConfig()
    - maybe this should be a perfect replacement for a config file
    - allows me to create a GUI for editing config files & maybe save per console/game configs
- GAMES
  - figure out good ways to load & save specific game configs
  - detect & enable/disable drivers for different controllers

GUI
- gui.back functionality -> close gui if appropriate
- Keyboard?
- generic component library
  - button (img or text, press & (optional) unpress functions)
  - slider (vertical/horizontal, force selection on slider, gui.up/down/left/right to edit value)
  - checkbox (button w/ on/off state, different img/text if on/off)
  - text input box?
  - selection dropdown (close on select/back, back restores original value)
  - Settings Category
    - change global settings dialog (updates global.cfg)
    - change windows settings (launch Settings)
- create GameSettings dialog
  - change game version
  - change controls
    - save controls as presets / default
    - create gui for creating custom controls
  - change game settings
    - use same dialog as change settings

LAUNCHBOX
- create plugin to send game metadata to main?
- create plugin to allow emualtors to have games with invalid file paths
- create plugin to launch GameSettings rather than using separate emulator
- maybe write directly into launchbox data the time played? (it probably wont work default)
