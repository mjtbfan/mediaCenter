- create abstract way to have controller interact with gui
  - GuiPosObj (map)
    - ID: name of guicontrol

    - Buttons: what the control should do if specific buttons are pressed
    - L, R, U, D: ids for the left, right, up, & down controls (need to figure out how to properly update existing buttons)
  - maybe if i figure out how to actually pass custom objects between threads
    - use separate thread to create/manage guis
    - share the gui hotkeys with hotkey script
- create Keyboard
- create PauseScreen
  - Home Button (default program)
  - Volume Button (pop-out volume mixer)
  - Controllers Button (pop-out show battery & vibrate button)

LAUNCHBOX
- create plugin to send game metadata to main?

- redesign theme for game details page
- update theme to work with any resolution?
- clean theme files
